To-Do List to myself for the Project :

Visuals :
- Improve beam texture
- Make one or two other magic circles for bigger spells
- Take a look at custom particles could be cool


General :
- Create SoundEffect System (possibly with custom sounds for some spells)
- Add "The Beam Spell" with a violet color and a name like "Infinity Equation" or smth as a ref to JJK
- Add More Spells, might tweet for some ideas
- Open Source it. And keep the code clean unless you want to be laughed at (cruel world)

Code Stuff :
- Find another way to center the item display because it causes problems for the placables spells hitbox probably using tp instead of translation
- Add "Scroll making system", involve elements cuz rn they're useless
- Make the whole "CanHarmCaster" and "doesConsumeScroll" thing

- Update the Ressource pack zipper plugin
