Minecraft Plugin that adds cool Mod-like magic stuff in minecraft vanilla (Needs a ressource pack zipper to work)


As a ressource pack zipper you can use your own like i plan to do (still in early developement so wont release it until like a couple months) or some 3rd party one i personally did my tests with ItemAdder by LoneDev so i know it works

Rn it works in 1.20.X, and i wont make compatibility for older versions (its not that i dont want to, its just basically impossible or not optimized at all)

im putting all the assets used in the ressource pack in the "assets" folder here if anyone wants them to use with the plugin
